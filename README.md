# Automated-Aquarium-using-Arduino

## Turbidity Sensor
This sensor measures the turbidity water (how much is it colored) in NTUs.

## Waterproof Temperature Sensor
This sensor measures the temperature of water in Celsius degrees.

## Buzzer
This will produce a loud 2KHz beep tone.

## LEDs
LEDs will be used to show if the sensors detects some problems or to show if the aquarim is working properly.

## Waterproof Submersible Water Pump
This pump is used to discharge the water

## Ultrasonic Sensor
This sensor is used to measure the level of the water.

## Continuous Rotation Micro Servo - FS90R
This servomotor is used to feed the fish.

## LCD 16x2 I2C
This LCS is used to display some information such as temperature.

## Wires
Wires connects the elements of circuit.

## Breadboards
- a breadboard for leds and LEDs for the user
- a breadboard for sensors that must be near the aquarim
- a breadboard near Arduino UNO microcontroller to connect several sensors

## Arduino UNO microcontroller
This controller will keep the code and control the operations in the circuit.

## Aquarim
For this project must have something greater than 30 cm tall because there a lot of wires and sensors.
